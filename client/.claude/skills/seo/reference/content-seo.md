## Keyword Research

### Understanding Keyword Metrics

#### Search Volume
Estimated monthly searches for a keyword.

**Strategy:**
- **High volume (10K+)** - Competitive, takes longer to rank, worth it for authority pages
- **Medium volume (1K-10K)** - Good target for new sites building momentum
- **Long-tail/low volume (100-1K)** - Easier to rank, multiple long-tails add up
- **Focus on long-tail first** - Build foundation of easy wins before targeting head terms

#### Keyword Difficulty (KD)
Estimated difficulty to rank for a keyword (scale usually 0-100).

**Strategy:**
- **New site** - Target KD 0-20 initially, then 20-40 as you build authority
- **Established site** - Can tackle KD 40-60 confidently
- **High KD (60+)** - Reserved for homepage or category pages with existing authority
- **Don't avoid difficulty** - Just target easier keywords initially to build momentum

#### Cost Per Click (CPC)
Advertiser value for keyword (higher CPC = higher commercial intent).

**Strategy:**
- **High CPC (>$2)** - Commercial intent keywords, valuable for monetization
- **Low CPC** - Often informational, easier to rank for
- **Balance** - Mix commercial intent keywords with informational content
- **For B2B** - CPC is less relevant; focus on search volume and difficulty

### Keyword Research Process

#### Step 1: Identify Seed Keywords
Start with 5-10 broad keywords related to your niche.

Examples for SaaS validation:
- SaaS validation
- Customer discovery
- Product validation
- Idea validation
- Go-to-market strategy

#### Step 2: Expand Keyword List
Use tools and patterns to expand (free tools: Google Keyword Planner, Ubersuggest):

**Question-based keywords:**
- "How to validate SaaS idea"
- "What is customer discovery"
- "Why is product validation important"

**Comparison keywords:**
- "Validation vs validation" (competitive positioning)
- "SaaS idea validation frameworks"

**Problem-statement keywords:**
- "How to validate SaaS idea without building"
- "Validate product idea with no budget"

**Long-tail variations:**
- "SaaS idea validation checklist"
- "SaaS idea validation process for startups"

#### Step 3: Prioritize Keywords
Create target keyword list:
1. Filter by search volume (minimum 100-200/month recommended)
2. Filter by keyword difficulty (match to your site authority)
3. Filter by relevance (must align with your expertise/offering)
4. Prioritize by opportunity score (volume + low difficulty = quick wins)

#### Step 4: Identify Primary & Secondary Keywords
For each page, identify:

**Primary keyword** - 1-2 words describing main topic, highest search volume, appears in title/H1
**Secondary keywords** - Related keywords to target in content, 3-5 per page
