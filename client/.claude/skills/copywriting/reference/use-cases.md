**Lead with**: The most common pain point across all groups (being unknown/undiscovered)

**Then segment**: Specific benefits for each ICP in your CTAs or landing page sections

**Example homepage structure**:
```
Hero: "Build Authority. Attract Leads." (universal)

Section 1: "For founders building in public"
Section 2: "For consultants attracting better clients"
Section 3: "For creators becoming recognized"
Section 4: "For marketers proving ROI"

CTA buttons: "For founders" | "For consultants" | "For creators" | "For marketers"
→ Each goes to ICP-specific landing page
```

## Red Flags: When Copy Doesn't Match the Use Case

- ❌ Using "startup" language for a consultant audience
- ❌ Emphasizing ROI tracking for founders who just want recognition
- ❌ Using "scale" language for solo consultants
- ❌ Talking about "passive income" for professionals
- ❌ Overcomplicating for creators who want simplicity

Each use case has different success metrics. Match your copy to their metric, not your feature list.
