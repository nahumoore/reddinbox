# Copywriting Frameworks for Reddinbox

## Framework 1: The Authority Realization (Landing Page Hero)

Use this for your homepage hero section and value propositions.

```
Headline: [Result they want] without [the thing they hate]
Sub: The anti-spam way to become the expert in your niche

Body:
1. Observation: "Your biggest competitors are getting recognized and generating leads from Reddit. You're not."
2. Reason: "They're probably not spending 20 hours a week there either. They're strategic."
3. Show them: "[Specific tactic] + [Reddinbox feature] = [Outcome]"
4. CTA: Aligned with their goal, not our goal
```

**Example**:
```
Headline: Build Authority on Reddit (Without Looking Like a Spammer)

Subheadline: Join [X] founders and consultants building recognized expertise in their niche. 
Generate qualified leads from people who already respect your work.

Body:
Your biggest competitors are getting recognized and generating leads from Reddit. You're not.
They're probably not spending 20 hours a week there either. They're strategic—they find 5 
high-impact conversations, craft thoughtful responses, and build authority. It takes 3 hours a week.

Find where your ideal customers ask questions → Contribute real value → Build your reputation
→ People come to you.

CTA: Start Building Authority (Free)
```

## Framework 2: Problem-Agitate-Solution (Email/Ad Copy)

Use this for cold email subject lines, ad copy, and promotional messaging.

```
Problem: "You have a good product but nobody outside your immediate circle knows about it"
Agitate: "Your competitors build authority on Reddit while you watch from the sidelines"
Solution: "Reddinbox turns community engagement into recognized expertise—3 hours a week"
Proof: "Used by [X] founders/consultants to generate $XXX in inbound revenue"
CTA: Link to specific use case
```

**Example email subject lines**:
- "Your competitor just got 5 leads from Reddit this week"
- "The Reddit playbook top founders use (and you're not)"
- "3 hours a week. 5 high-fit leads a month. Here's how."

---

## Framework 3: Objection Arc (Feature Copy)

Use this when addressing common objections or explaining why a feature matters.

```
Objection: "[Common concern]"
Reframe: "[Why this concern is addressed or reframed]"
Proof: "[Specific evidence, mechanism, or example]"
Outcome: "[What they get as a result]"
```

**Example 1: The Spam Concern**
```
Objection: "Reddit feels spammy and I don't want to be 'that guy'"
Reframe: "You're not—because we help you contribute actual value"
Proof: "Every response is personalized to your voice, helpful to the community, and builds 
your reputation. No templates. No sales-y language. Just genuine expertise."
Outcome: "People recognize your expertise. Some become customers."
```

**Example 2: The Time Concern**
```
Objection: "I don't have time to engage on Reddit"
Reframe: "You don't have time NOT to. But you don't need to spend all week there"
Proof: "Prioritize 5 conversations/week + AI-powered responses = 3 hours"
Outcome: "Consistent authority building with minimal time investment"
```

---

## Framework 4: Specific Outcome (Case Studies/Testimonials)

Use this structure for case studies, success stories, and testimonial quotes.

```
Before: Specific situation (not generic "didn't have growth")
Action: What they did with Reddinbox (be specific about features/time)
After: Measurable change (engagement, followers, inbound interest, revenue impact)
Quote: Their specific insight or aha moment
```

**Example**:
```
Before: Sarah, a solo SEO consultant, was good at her craft but unknown in her niche. 
Cold email wasn't working. Paid ads felt like throwing money away.

Action: She connected her Reddit account to Reddinbox and set it up to find conversations 
in 3 subreddits where her ideal clients asked questions. Every week, she'd spend 1-2 hours 
crafting thoughtful responses using Reddinbox's framework.

After: Within 6 weeks, she was recognized in those communities. Within 3 months, inbound 
inquiries increased 300%. She now generates 5-8 qualified leads per month just from Reddit.

Quote: "I'm not spending more time on Reddit than before. I'm just spending it smarter. 
And people actually know who I am now. That changes everything."
```

## Framework 5: Feature Benefit Translation

Use this when writing feature descriptions to ensure they highlight outcomes, not mechanics.

**Bad (Feature-focused)**:
- "AI-powered response generation"
- "Subreddit prioritization algorithm"
- "Engagement tracking dashboard"

**Good (Outcome-focused)**:
- "Responses that sound like you, help the community, and build your reputation"
- "Find where your ideal customers are asking questions—spend 3 hours there instead of 30"
- "See how your authority grows. Track mentions, followers, inbound interest in real time"

**Translation process**:
1. Start with the feature: "Smart prioritization"
2. Ask: "What problem does this solve?" → Wastes time finding relevant conversations
3. Ask: "What's the outcome?" → Spend time strategically
4. Rewrite: "Find the 5 conversations where your ideal customers are asking questions. Focus your effort there instead of everywhere."

## Common Copy Scenarios & Templates

### Scenario 1: Email Cold Open

```
Subject: [Observation about their space]

Hi [Name],

I noticed you're building [product/service] in [niche]. Your target audience is asking 
questions about [specific problem] on Reddit right now.

Most founders don't realize that [niche] communities on Reddit are where [ideal customer type] 
hang out when they're evaluating solutions. Your competitors probably are.

Just curious—are you currently engaging there, or is that a distribution channel you haven't 
tapped yet?

[Your name]
```

### Scenario 2: Homepage CTA Text

```
Instead of: "Sign Up Now"
Write: "Start Building Authority"

Instead of: "Learn More"
Write: "See How It Works"

Instead of: "Get Started"
Write: "Join [Number] Builders"
```

### Scenario 3: Empty State (No Data Yet)

```
Instead of: "No interactions yet"
Write: "Your Reddit conversations are waiting. Connect your first Reddit account and 
we'll find high-impact opportunities where your ideal customers are asking questions."
```

### Scenario 4: Success Milestone

```
Instead of: "You've reached 100 interactions"
Write: "You're building momentum. 100 people have engaged with your responses. 
That's 100 opportunities to make an impression as the expert in your space."
```
