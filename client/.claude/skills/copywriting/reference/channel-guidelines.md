CTA: "Start Building Authority (Free)"

PROBLEM:
Headline: "Your competitors are being recognized. You're not."

Your ideal customers are on Reddit right now, asking questions. Your competitors are answering. 
You're not even in the conversation."

SOLUTION:

## Email Sequences

### Purpose
Build relationship, prove value, get them to try Reddinbox.

### Key Rules
- **Subject lines**: Curiosity or specificity, never fake urgency
- **Body**: Conversational, 3-4 short paragraphs max
- **CTA per email**: One primary, one "learn more" link
- **Tone**: Like a peer sharing what worked, not a salesperson

### Email 1: The Hook (Subject + First Impression)

```
Subject: "Your competitor is building authority on Reddit"

Body:
Hi [Name],

I noticed you're building [specific thing] in [niche]. Quick observation: your ideal 
customers are asking questions about [specific problem] on Reddit right now.

Most founders don't realize that communities like [subreddit] have thousands of people 
exactly like your target market. They're evaluating solutions. Your competitors are there.

Just curiousâ€”are you currently engaging there, or is that a channel you haven't prioritized?

[Your name]

P.S. Here's how [competitor/similar founder] is doing it: [specific example]
```

### Email 2: The Specificity (Show You Understand)

```
Subject: "Why 3 hours on Reddit works (when 30 don't)"

Body:
Most people approach Reddit all wrong. They try to be everywhere. They get overwhelmed. 
They give up.

Here's what works: Find 3 subreddits where your ideal customers hang out. Spend 1 hour 
per week in each. Answer the questions that matter. Build your reputation intentionally.

That's it. 3 hours. Compound effect over weeks.

The hard part? Finding the right communities and knowing what to say that doesn't sound spammy.

That's what Reddinbox does.

[Learn how it works â†’]
```

### Email 3: The Proof (Show It Works)

```
Subject: "[Name], here's what [founder] generated from Reddit"

Body:
[Founder] was in your exact situation 6 months ago. Unknown in [niche]. Cold email wasn't 
working.

She set up Reddinbox. Spent 3 hours a week in [specific subreddit]. Within 3 months, 
she generated [X] qualified leads. [Y] of them became customers.

Her quote: "[specific insight about authority building]"

Think Reddit's just for procrastination? It's actually where your customers are.

[See the full story â†’]
```

### Email 4: The CTA (Permission to Try)

```
Subject: "One free week on us"

Body:
You can tell if Reddinbox is right for you in one week.

You'll spend one week contributing helpful responses. By week's end, you'll know if

## In-App Copy (Onboarding, Empty States, Features)

### Purpose
Guide user to value as quickly as possible.

### Key Rules
- **Onboarding**: Show outcome first ("Here's where your next leads will come from"), then method
- **Empty states**: Always show next action, never just "no data"
- **Feature explanations**: Start with WHY (problem solved), then HOW to use it
- **Error messages**: Helpful, not blaming

### Onboarding Examples

```
Step 1 - Connect Reddit Account:
Headline: "Let's find where your customers are asking questions"
Description: "Connect your Reddit account so we can analyze your niche and find high-impact conversations."

Step 2 - Select Your Niche:
Headline: "What's your main area of expertise?"
Description: "This helps us identify the right communities where your ideal customers hang out."

Step 3 - Review Your Communities:
Headline: "Here are the 5 communities where your next opportunities are waiting"
Description: "You'll spend ~3 hours a week here. We'll help you find conversations and craft responses."

Step 4 - First Response:
Headline: "Your first response builds momentum"
Description: "We've found a recent question where your expertise would help. Let's craft your response together."
```

### Empty State Examples

```
No Reddit Accounts Connected Yet:
"No Reddit accounts connected yet. Connect your first account to start finding the conversations 
where your ideal customers are asking questions."
[Connect your first account â†’]

No Opportunities Yet:
"We're still analyzing your niche. Check back in a few hoursâ€”we'll have identified the best 
conversations for you to contribute to."

No Interactions Yet:
"You're all set up. The next high-impact conversations in your niche are waiting. 
Spend 30 minutes this week contributing helpful responses and building your authority."
[Find conversations â†’]
```

### Feature Copy

```
Instead of: "AI-powered response generation"
Write: "We help you craft responses that sound like you, help the community, and build your 
reputation. No templates. Just your voice applied strategically."

Instead of: "Subreddit prioritization algorithm"
Write: "We analyze your niche and identify where your ideal customers are asking questions. 
Focus your effort there instead of everywhere."

Instead of: "Engagement tracking dashboard"
Write: "Watch your authority grow. Track how many people recognize you, save your responses, 
and engage with your comments. See the compound effect in real time."
```

## Social Media & Twitter

### Purpose
Share insights, prove credibility, drive awareness.

### Key Rules
- **Tweets**: Insight or surprising data point + personal experience
  - Start with hook (problem or contradiction)
  - Show evidence or specific number
  - End with the insight or lesson
- **Tone**: More personal, more vulnerable, less corporate
- **Engagement**: Reply thoughtfully to threads; build community, not audience

### Tweet Templates

```
TYPE 1: The Contradiction
"Everyone says 'build on Twitter.' But I generated 5 leads from Reddit this week and 0 from 
Twitter. Turns out your customers are where the problems are being solved, not where people 
are posting takes. ðŸ§µ"

TYPE 2: The Specific Number
"I asked a question on r/SaaS. Got 200 upvotes. 5 people asked to learn about my product. 
That's when I realized: authority on Reddit isn't about promotion. It's about helping. 
Reddinbox just made it 3x faster to do."

TYPE 3: The Insight
"Most Reddit 'growth' tactics fail because they're spammy. The ones that work? They help 
people first and build reputation second. That's not growth hacking. That's just business."

TYPE 4: The Pattern
"Pattern I'm noticing: founders who build in public on Reddit have easier sales conversations. 
People already know what you do. They're just deciding if they like you. Authority changes everything."
```

### Reply/Engagement Examples

```
If someone tweets about cold email not working:
"Cold email works if you already have credibility. If not, try Reddit. Your customers 
are there asking questions. Answer helpfully for 3 months. Then cold email will actually work."

If someone tweets about distribution challenges:
"Reddit is underrated for B2B. Most people think it's just memes. But r/[industry] has 
[specific number] high-intent people evaluating solutions. Spend 3 hours there this week. 
You'll see what I mean."
```
