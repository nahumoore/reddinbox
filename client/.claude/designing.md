# UI/UX Best Practices & Styling Guide

## Comprehensive Design Guidelines for Building Pages (2025)

## Introduction & Philosophy

### Purpose of This Guide

This document serves as a comprehensive reference for creating user-centered, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing web pages. It consolidates industry best practices from leading design systems (Material Design, IBM Carbon, Microsoft Fluent) and accessibility standards for 2025.

### Design First Principles

**1. Constraints Drive Better Design**
Start with the most restrictive environment (mobile, accessibility needs, slow networks). These constraints force clarity and prioritization, resulting in better experiences across all platforms.

**2. User Needs Over Designer Preferences**
Every design decision should serve user goals, not aesthetic preferences. Beautiful design that frustrates users is failed design.

**3. Consistency Builds Trust**
Users feel confident when patterns are predictable. Inconsistency creates cognitive load and erodes trust.

**4. Progressive Enhancement**
Build core functionality first, then layer enhancements for capable devices and browsers.

**5. Test Early, Test Often**
Assumptions about usability are frequently wrong. Real user testing reveals the truth.

---

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Clarity Is King

**What It Means**
Users should instantly understand what to do and where to go. Every element should have a clear, single purpose.

**Implementation Guidelines**

- Remove unnecessary elements ruthlessly
- Use clear, action-oriented labels ("Download Report" not "Click Here")
- Ensure visual hierarchy is obvious at a glance
- Group related elements together
- Provide immediate feedback for all interactions

**Bad Practice**: Multiple competing call-to-action buttons with unclear labels
**Good Practice**: One primary action button with clear outcome ("Start Free Trial")

---

### 2. Consistency Creates Predictability

**What It Means**
Similar elements should look and behave the same throughout your interface. Users transfer learning from one part of your site to another.

**Implementation Guidelines**

- Use the same button style for all primary actions
- Maintain consistent spacing between similar elements
- Keep navigation in the same location across pages
- Use uniform iconography styles
- Apply consistent typography hierarchy

**Jakob's Law**: Users spend most of their time on OTHER websites. They prefer your site to work like the ones they already know.

**Design System Approach**
Create a component library where:

- Buttons have defined states (default, hover, active, disabled)
- Form elements follow consistent patterns
- Card components share structure
- Spacing follows a systematic scale

---

### 3. Visual Hierarchy Guides Attention

**What It Means**
Important elements should be visually dominant. Create clear paths for the eye to follow.

**Hierarchy Tools**

- **Size**: Larger elements draw attention first
- **Color**: High contrast creates emphasis
- **Position**: Top-left gets noticed first (in LTR languages)
- **Whitespace**: Isolation creates importance
- **Typography**: Weight and style signal hierarchy

**Reading Patterns**

- **F-Pattern**: Users scan in an F-shape (headlines, first words of paragraphs)
- **Z-Pattern**: Eye moves in Z-shape across key elements (landing pages, hero sections)
- **Layer Cake Pattern**: Horizontal sections scanned top to bottom

---

### 4. Progressive Disclosure

**What It Means**
Show users what they need now, hide advanced features until needed. Prevent overwhelming users with options.

**Implementation Strategies**

- **Layered Navigation**: Primary items visible, secondary in expandable sections
- **Accordion Patterns**: Expand sections on demand
- **Step-by-Step Wizards**: Break complex processes into manageable steps
- **Tooltips**: Show help on hover/focus for advanced features
- **Collapsible Panels**: Hide detailed options initially

**Example Flow**

1. Show 3-5 primary features prominently
2. Place advanced settings in a Settings panel
3. Use "Show More" for additional options
4. Provide inline help for complex features

---

### 5. Immediate Feedback

**What It Means**
Every user action must receive immediate visual confirmation. Silence creates uncertainty.

**Feedback Types**

- **State Changes**: Buttons change on hover, active, disabled
- **Loading Indicators**: Spinners, progress bars, skeleton screens
- **Success Messages**: Confirmations for completed actions
- **Error Alerts**: Clear explanations when things go wrong
- **Validation Feedback**: Inline messages as users type

**Timing Guidelines**

- **< 100ms**: Feels instantaneous, no indicator needed
- **100ms - 1s**: Smooth transition, simple indicator
- **1s - 10s**: Progress indicator required
- **> 10s**: Show percentage complete or time remaining

---

### 6. Familiarity Reduces Cognitive Load

**What It Means**
Use established patterns and conventions. Innovation should serve user needs, not novelty.

**Common Patterns to Follow**

- Shopping cart icon for e-commerce
- Magnifying glass for search
- Hamburger menu for mobile navigation
- Blue underlined text for links (or clear alternatives)
- Logo in top-left linking to homepage
- Three horizontal lines for menu
- Heart icon for favorites/likes

**When to Break Conventions**
Only when you have strong evidence that a new pattern serves users better. Test thoroughly.

---

### 7. Error Prevention Over Error Messages

**What It Means**
Design to prevent errors before they happen. Helping users avoid mistakes is better than explaining them.

**Prevention Strategies**

- Disable unavailable options (gray out past dates)
- Provide constraints (dropdowns instead of free text)
- Use smart defaults (pre-fill known information)
- Show format examples ("Format: MM/DD/YYYY")
- Implement inline validation (check as user types)
- Confirm destructive actions ("Are you sure you want to delete?")

---

### 8. Aesthetic-Usability Effect

**What It Means**
Users perceive visually appealing designs as more usable. Beauty creates tolerance for minor usability issues.

**Important Caveat**
Never sacrifice usability for aesthetics. Use beauty to enhance good function, not mask bad function.

**Balancing Act**

- Prioritize function first, then refine appearance
- Beautiful AND usable is the goal
- Polish enhances perception but doesn't replace substance

---

## Accessibility Standards

### WCAG 2.2 Compliance Overview

**Target Level**: AA (industry standard, legal requirement in most jurisdictions)

**Legal Context**

- EU: European Accessibility Act (EAA) compliance required by June 2025
- US: ADA Title II website compliance deadline April 2026
- Non-compliance fines: Up to $200,000 EUR (Europe), $150,000 USD (US)

**Business Benefits Beyond Compliance**

- Expands market reach (20% of population has disabilities)
- Improves SEO (accessible sites rank better)
- Enhances overall UX for all users
- Reduces legal risk

---

### The Four POUR Principles

#### Perceivable

**Information must be presented in ways all users can perceive**

**Color Contrast Requirements**

- Normal text: 4.5:1 minimum ratio
- Large text (18pt+ or 14pt+ bold): 3:1 minimum ratio
- UI components and graphics: 3:1 minimum ratio
- Don't rely on color alone to convey information

Tailwind Reference: Use `text-gray-900 bg-white` for high contrast, avoid `text-gray-400 bg-gray-100`

**Alternative Text for Images**

- Meaningful images: Descriptive alt text
- Decorative images: Empty alt attribute
- Complex graphics: Detailed descriptions
- Icons with text: Alt text matches visible text

**Captions and Transcripts**

- Videos require captions
- Audio content needs transcripts
- Live content should have real-time captions

**Text Alternatives**

- All non-text content needs text equivalent
- Charts need data tables
- Maps need text directions

---

#### Operable

**User interfaces must be operable by everyone**

**Keyboard Navigation**

- All functionality available via keyboard
- Tab order follows logical reading order
- No keyboard traps (users can always escape)
- Visible focus indicators on all interactive elements

Tailwind Reference: Add `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:outline-none` to interactive elements

**Touch Target Sizing**

- Minimum: 44x44 pixels (WCAG 2.2 requirement)
- Recommended: 48x48 pixels for better usability
- Spacing: 8px minimum between touch targets

Tailwind Reference: Use `min-w-[44px] min-h-[44px] p-3` for buttons

**Timing Flexibility**

- Allow users to extend time limits
- Provide pause/stop for auto-updating content
- No flashing content (seizure risk)
- Users control timing when possible

**Navigation Aids**

- Skip links to main content
- Multiple ways to find pages (menu, search, sitemap)
- Clear page titles
- Descriptive link text (not "click here")

---

#### Understandable

**Users must be able to understand content and interface**

**Language Declaration**

- Declare primary page language
- Mark language changes in content
- Use clear, simple language when possible

**Predictable Behavior**

- Navigation consistent across pages
- Components behave consistently
- No unexpected context changes
- Warn before major changes

**Input Assistance**

- Clear labels for all form fields
- Helpful error messages
- Instructions for complex inputs
- Error prevention and correction suggestions

**Reading Level**

- Target 8th-9th grade reading level for general audiences
- Use plain language principles
- Define technical terms
- Break up long paragraphs

---

#### Robust

**Content must work across technologies and assistive devices**

**Semantic HTML**

- Use proper HTML elements for their purpose
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h6)
- Lists for list content
- Tables for tabular data

**ARIA When Needed**

- Use native HTML first
- Add ARIA for complex widgets
- Ensure proper role, state, and properties
- Never break native semantics with ARIA

**Valid Markup**

- Clean, valid HTML structure
- Proper nesting of elements
- Closed tags and attributes
- No duplicate IDs

---

### Semantic HTML Hierarchy

**Heading Structure**

- One h1 per page (page title)
- Don't skip heading levels (h1 → h2 → h3, never h1 → h3)
- Headings create document outline for screen readers
- Use headings for structure, not styling

**Document Landmarks**

- header: Site/page header
- nav: Navigation sections
- main: Primary content (one per page)
- article: Self-contained content
- section: Thematic grouping
- aside: Related but separate content
- footer: Site/page footer

**Proper Nesting**

- Interactive elements inside buttons/links
- Form inputs inside labels or associated with labels
- List items inside ul/ol elements
- Table cells inside table rows

---

### Accessibility Quick Checks

**Before Launch Checklist**

- [ ] All images have alt text
- [ ] Color contrast meets 4.5:1 (normal text) or 3:1 (large text)
- [ ] Can navigate entire site with keyboard only
- [ ] Focus indicators visible on all interactive elements
- [ ] Forms have proper labels
- [ ] Page has descriptive title
- [ ] Headings follow proper hierarchy
- [ ] Links have descriptive text
- [ ] No flashing content
- [ ] Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- [ ] Videos have captions
- [ ] Semantic HTML used throughout

---

## Responsive & Mobile-First Design

### Why Mobile-First in 2025

**The Data**

- 60%+ of web traffic is mobile
- Google uses mobile-first indexing for SEO
- Mobile users have different contexts and goals
- Easier to scale up than scale down

**Mobile-First Methodology**

1. Design for smallest screen first (320-480px)
2. Define core content and features
3. Add enhancements for larger screens
4. Test on real devices, not just simulators

---

### Viewport Configuration

**Essential Meta Tag**
Always include this in your HTML head - it's not optional.

Without it, mobile browsers will lie about viewport width and zoom out your page.

---

### Breakpoint Strategy

**Philosophy**: Use relative units, not device-specific pixels

**Common Breakpoints**

- **Mobile**: 320-768px (base styles)
- **Tablet**: 768-1024px (medium enhancements)
- **Desktop**: 1024-1280px (large layouts)
- **Wide**: 1280px+ (extra-large enhancements)

**Tailwind Approach**

- Default styles = mobile
- Add `md:` prefix for tablet+
- Add `lg:` prefix for desktop+
- Add `xl:` prefix for wide screens+

Example: `text-sm md:text-base lg:text-lg`

---

### Layout Patterns

**Mobile Layout Principles**

- Single column layouts
- Stack elements vertically
- Full-width content containers
- Collapsible navigation
- Bottom navigation for key actions
- Minimize horizontal scrolling

**Tablet Adaptations**

- Two-column layouts where appropriate
- Reveal more navigation options
- Larger touch targets
- Utilize increased screen real estate

**Desktop Enhancements**

- Multi-column layouts
- Persistent navigation
- Hover states
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Dense information display

---

### Touch-Friendly Design

**Touch Target Requirements**

- Minimum size: 44x44px (WCAG 2.2)
- Recommended: 48x48px
- Spacing between targets: 8px minimum

Tailwind: `min-h-[44px] min-w-[44px] p-3 m-2`

**Touch Considerations**

- Design for thumbs, not mouse cursors
- Place key actions in thumb-reach zones
- Avoid hover-only interactions
- Large, tappable areas
- Clear active/pressed states

**Thumb Zones**

- **Easy**: Bottom center and sides
- **Stretch**: Top corners
- **Natural**: Bottom third of screen

---

### Mobile Navigation Patterns

**Hamburger Menu** (Most Common)

- Icon: Three horizontal lines
- Reveals full menu on tap
- Should be labeled or have clear icon
- Include close button in menu

**Bottom Navigation** (App-Style)

- 3-5 key sections
- Icons with labels
- Always visible
- Current section highlighted

**Tab Bar**

- Horizontal tabs at top
- Swipeable content
- Active tab clearly indicated
- Maximum 5-7 tabs

**Priority+** (Advanced)

- Shows as many items as fit
- Overflow items in "More" menu
- Adapts to screen size

---

### Content Strategy for Mobile

**Progressive Disclosure**

- Show essential content first
- Hide details in expandable sections
- Reduce clutter
- Prioritize ruthlessly

**Typography Adjustments**

- Larger base font size (16px minimum)
- Shorter line lengths
- More line height (1.5-1.6)
- Scannable paragraphs (3-4 sentences max)

**Image Optimization**

- Use responsive images
- Lazy load off-screen images
- Compress aggressively
- Provide multiple resolutions

---

## Visual Hierarchy & Layout

### Establishing Clear Hierarchy

**Size & Scale**

- Larger elements = more important
- Use consistent scale ratios (1.25x, 1.5x, 2x)
- Create clear distinction between levels

**Weight & Emphasis**

- Bold for important information
- Regular for body text
- Light for secondary information

Tailwind: `font-bold`, `font-normal`, `font-light`

**Color & Contrast**

- High contrast for critical elements
- Muted colors for less important content
- Color + additional indicators (don't rely on color alone)

**Position & Placement**

- Top = most important
- Left = noticed before right (in LTR languages)
- Center = focal point for key actions

---

### F-Pattern Reading

**What Users See First**

1. Top horizontal area (headline, navigation)
2. Left vertical area (first words of sections)
3. Second horizontal area (subheadings)

**Design Implications**

- Front-load important information
- Use clear headings
- Make first words of paragraphs count
- Don't hide key content in center/right

---

### Z-Pattern Scanning

**Flow of Attention**

1. Top left → top right (header, logo → navigation)
2. Diagonal drop → bottom left
3. Bottom left → bottom right (call-to-action)

**Best For**

- Landing pages
- Hero sections
- Minimal content pages
- Single conversion goal pages

---

### Whitespace Principles

**Macro Whitespace** (Between Major Sections)

- Creates breathing room
- Separates distinct content areas
- Establishes rhythm
- Recommended: 64-96px between sections

Tailwind: `space-y-16` or `space-y-24`

**Micro Whitespace** (Within Elements)

- Improves readability
- Groups related items
- Creates hierarchy within components
- Recommended: 8-24px within elements

Tailwind: `space-y-2`, `space-y-4`, `space-y-6`

**The 60-30-10 Rule**

- 60%: Whitespace and backgrounds
- 30%: Content
- 10%: Accent colors and calls-to-action

---

### Container & Grid Systems

**Content Containers**

- Maximum width for readability: 1200-1400px
- Center containers on wide screens
- Padding: 16-24px mobile, 24-48px desktop

Tailwind: `container mx-auto px-4 md:px-6 lg:px-8`

**Reading Width**

- Optimal: 50-75 characters per line
- Maximum: 90 characters
- Narrow columns improve reading comprehension

Tailwind: `max-w-prose` (65 characters)

**Grid Layouts**

- 12-column grid is standard
- Flexible column spans
- Consistent gutters (16-24px)
- Responsive column counts

Tailwind: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6`

---

### Z-Index Management

**Establish Clear Layers**

- Base content: 0
- Dropdowns: 10
- Sticky elements: 20
- Fixed headers: 30
- Modal backdrops: 40
- Modals: 50
- Tooltips: 60

**Best Practice**
Define your z-index scale and stick to it. Don't use arbitrary high numbers (z-9999).

---

## Typography System

### Type Scale Hierarchy

**Recommended Scale** (1.25 ratio)

- **Tiny**: 12px - Fine print, captions
- **Small**: 14px - Secondary information
- **Base**: 16px - Body text (never go smaller)
- **Large**: 18-20px - Prominent body text
- **XL**: 24px - Subheadings
- **2XL**: 30px - Section headings
- **3XL**: 36px - Page headings
- **4XL**: 48px - Hero headings
- **5XL**: 60px+ - Display text

Tailwind: `text-xs`, `text-sm`, `text-base`, `text-lg`, `text-xl`, `text-2xl`, `text-3xl`, `text-4xl`, `text-5xl`

---

### Font Selection

**System Font Stack** (Fastest, Most Reliable)
Uses native fonts from user's operating system:

- Zero download time
- Familiar to users
- Excellent performance

**Web Fonts** (Brand-Specific Typography)

- Limit to 2 font families maximum
- Load only weights you actually use (typically 400, 600, 700)
- Use font-display: swap for performance
- Provide fallback system fonts

**Font Pairing**

- Heading font + body font
- Maximum 2-3 font families site-wide
- Ensure contrast (serif + sans-serif, or varied weights)

---

### Readability Guidelines

**Line Height (Leading)**

- Body text: 1.5-1.8 (150-180% of font size)
- Headings: 1.1-1.3 (tighter for large text)
- Small text: 1.4-1.6

Tailwind: `leading-relaxed` (1.625), `leading-loose` (2), `leading-tight` (1.25)

**Line Length**

- Ideal: 50-75 characters per line
- Acceptable: 45-90 characters
- Too long = eye fatigue
- Too short = choppy reading

**Paragraph Spacing**

- Space between paragraphs: 1.5-2x line height
- Don't indent if you space paragraphs
- Use space OR indent, not both

Tailwind: `space-y-4` or `space-y-6` between paragraphs

**Letter Spacing (Tracking)**

- Body text: Normal (0)
- All caps: Slightly increased (+0.05em)
- Large headings: Slightly decreased (-0.02em)
- Small text: Slightly increased (+0.01em)

Tailwind: `tracking-tight`, `tracking-normal`, `tracking-wide`

---

### Text Hierarchy Best Practices

**Clear Distinction Between Levels**

- Each heading level should be noticeably different
- Use size + weight + spacing to differentiate
- Maintain consistency across site

**Heading Guidelines**

- H1: One per page, describes page content
- H2: Major section breaks
- H3: Subsections within H2
- H4-H6: Deeper nesting (use sparingly)

**Body Text Standards**

- 16px minimum for mobile (never smaller)
- 18px recommended for comfortable reading
- Line length affects optimal size

---

### Font Weight Usage

**Weight Hierarchy**

- **Light (300)**: Sparingly, for emphasis or large sizes
- **Regular (400)**: Body text default
- **Medium (500)**: Slightly emphasized text
- **Semibold (600)**: Subheadings, important labels
- **Bold (700)**: Headings, critical information
- **Extra Bold (800+)**: Rare, only for major headings

Tailwind: `font-light`, `font-normal`, `font-medium`, `font-semibold`, `font-bold`

---

### Special Text Treatments

**Links**

- Distinguish clearly from regular text
- Underline OR distinct color (not just color alone)
- Hover state different from default
- Visited state optional but helpful

Tailwind: `text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800`

**Emphasis**

- Use bold for strong emphasis
- Use italic sparingly
- Avoid underline for emphasis (reserved for links)
- Color for categorization, not emphasis

**All Caps**

- Use sparingly (labels, short headings)
- Increase letter spacing slightly
- Never for long-form content (harder to read)
- Always provide alternative if critical information

Tailwind: `uppercase tracking-wide`

---

## Color Theory & Application

### Color Contrast Requirements

**WCAG 2.2 Standards**

- Normal text (< 18pt): 4.5:1 minimum
- Large text (≥ 18pt or ≥ 14pt bold): 3:1 minimum
- UI components: 3:1 minimum
- Graphical objects: 3:1 minimum

**Testing Tools**

- WebAIM Contrast Checker
- Adobe Color Accessibility Tool
- Browser DevTools accessibility panels

**Don't Rely on Color Alone**
Always provide additional indicators:

- Icons + color for status
- Text labels + color for categories
- Patterns + color for charts

---

### Color Psychology & Application

**Primary Colors** (Brand Identity)

- Represents brand personality
- Used for main actions and key elements
- Limit usage to maintain impact
- Ensure sufficient contrast with backgrounds

**Secondary Colors** (Supporting Elements)

- Complement primary color
- Used for secondary actions
- Provides variety without overwhelming
- Maintains visual hierarchy

**Neutral Colors** (Foundation)

- Backgrounds, borders, text
- Grays, whites, blacks
- Most of your interface should be neutral
- Provides stability and readability

**Semantic Colors** (Meaning)

- **Red/Danger**: Errors, deletion, urgent warnings
- **Yellow/Warning**: Caution, alerts, important notices
- **Green/Success**: Completed actions, confirmations
- **Blue/Info**: General information, helpful tips

---

### Color Palette Structure

**Recommended Palette**

- Primary: 5-7 shades (50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900)
- Neutral grays: 7-9 shades
- Semantic colors: 3-5 shades each
- Accent: 1-2 additional colors (optional)

Tailwind Example: `bg-blue-50` (lightest) to `bg-blue-900` (darkest)

**Usage Guidelines**

- Use lighter shades for backgrounds
- Mid-range shades for buttons and UI elements
- Darker shades for text and emphasis
- Maintain consistent contrast ratios across shades

---

### Color Accessibility Best Practices

**Text Color Combinations**
Good combinations for readability:

- Dark text on light backgrounds (black on white)
- Light text on dark backgrounds (white on dark gray)
- Sufficient contrast for color vision deficiencies

Avoid:

- Light gray text on white backgrounds
- Pure black text on pure white (can be harsh - use off-black)
- Red and green as only differentiators (color blindness)

**State Indication**

- Disabled elements: Lower contrast but still readable (3:1 minimum)
- Focus states: Clear, high-contrast indicators
- Active states: Visual change plus color

---

### Dark Mode Considerations

**If Implementing Dark Mode**

- Don't just invert colors
- Use softer whites (off-white) to reduce eye strain
- Maintain contrast ratios (4.5:1 for text)
- Test thoroughly with real users
- Provide easy toggle option
- Remember system preference

Tailwind: Use `dark:` prefix (e.g., `bg-white dark:bg-gray-900`)

---

## Spacing & Rhythm

### Spacing Scale System

**8-Point Grid** (Industry Standard)
Base unit: 8px. All spacing is multiples of 8.

**Recommended Scale**

- **2px** (0.125rem): Hairline borders
- **4px** (0.25rem): Minimum spacing
- **8px** (0.5rem): Tight spacing
- **12px** (0.75rem): Compact spacing
- **16px** (1rem): Base spacing
- **24px** (1.5rem): Medium spacing
- **32px** (2rem): Large spacing
- **48px** (3rem): Section spacing
- **64px** (4rem): Major section spacing
- **96px** (6rem): Hero spacing

Tailwind: `space-y-1` (4px) through `space-y-24` (96px)

---

### Spacing Application

**Component Internal Spacing**

- Buttons: 12-16px padding
- Cards: 16-24px padding
- Form fields: 12-16px padding
- List items: 8-12px padding

Tailwind: `p-3` or `p-4` for buttons, `p-4` or `p-6` for cards

**Component Spacing (Margins)**

- Related elements: 8-16px
- Grouped sections: 24-32px
- Major sections: 48-64px
- Page sections: 64-96px

Tailwind: `space-y-2` to `space-y-4` within groups, `space-y-12` to `space-y-16` between sections

**Responsive Spacing**

- Smaller spacing on mobile
- Increase spacing as screen size grows
- Maintain proportional relationships

Tailwind: `space-y-4 md:space-y-6 lg:space-y-8`

---

### Visual Rhythm

**Consistent Spacing Creates Rhythm**

- Use same spacing values throughout
- Create predictable patterns
- Rhythm makes interfaces feel cohesive
- Exceptions should be intentional

**Vertical Rhythm**

- Maintain consistent spacing between text blocks
- Align elements to baseline grid
- Use multiples of base line height

---

### Gutters & Margins

**Page Margins**

- Mobile: 16-24px sides
- Tablet: 24-32px sides
- Desktop: 32-48px sides or percentage-based
- Prevent content from touching edges

Tailwind: `px-4 md:px-6 lg:px-8`

**Grid Gutters**

- Space between grid columns
- Typically 16-24px
- Consistent across breakpoints or scaled up

Tailwind: `gap-4` or `gap-6`

**Safe Areas**

- Account for device notches and rounded corners
- Use viewport units with caution
- Test on actual devices

---

## Interactive Elements

### Button Design

**Button Hierarchy**

- **Primary**: Main action, most prominent (solid, high contrast)
- **Secondary**: Alternative actions (outline or subtle fill)
- **Tertiary**: Low-priority actions (text only or ghost)
- **Danger**: Destructive actions (red, solid)

Tailwind: `bg-blue-600 text-white` (primary), `border-2 border-blue-600 text-blue-600` (secondary), `text-blue-600` (tertiary)

**Button States**

- **Default**: Resting state
- **Hover**: Slightly darker or elevated
- **Active/Pressed**: Darker or inset
- **Focus**: Clear outline or ring
- **Disabled**: Reduced opacity, no cursor
- **Loading**: Spinner, disabled interaction

Tailwind: `hover:bg-blue-700 active:bg-blue-800 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 disabled:opacity-50`

**Size Guidelines**

- **Small**: 32-36px height, compact padding
- **Medium**: 40-44px height (default)
- **Large**: 48-56px height, generous padding

Tailwind: `px-4 py-2` (medium), `px-6 py-3` (large)

---

### Links

**Link Styling**

- Clearly distinguish from regular text
- Default: Underline + color (blue traditionally)
- Hover: Change color or underline style
- Visited: Optional different color
- Focus: Clear focus ring

Tailwind: `text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500`

**Link Context**

- Descriptive text ("Read our privacy policy" not "Click here")
- Indicate external links
- Warn before downloads or leaving site

---

### Form Controls

**Text Inputs**

- Clear borders
- Adequate padding (12-16px)
- Large enough for easy clicking (44px height minimum)
- Clear focus state
- Associated labels
- Helpful placeholder text (not as labels)

Tailwind: `border-2 border-gray-300 rounded px-4 py-3 focus:border-blue-500 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-200`

**Checkboxes & Radio Buttons**

- Large enough to tap (minimum 24x24px, 44x44px with padding)
- Clear checked state
- Label associated and clickable
- Grouped logically

**Select Dropdowns**

- Clear current selection
- Arrow indicator
- Easy to open on mobile
- Consider alternatives for long lists

**Textareas**

- Adequate height (3-5 lines visible)
- Resizable or fixed based on use case
- Character count if limit exists

---

### Icons

**Icon Usage**

- Support text, don't replace it
- Consistent style throughout (outline OR solid, not mixed)
- Appropriate size (16-24px for inline, 24-48px for standalone)
- Always pair with labels for important actions

Tailwind: `w-5 h-5` for inline, `w-12 h-12` for standalone

**Icon Accessibility**

- Provide text alternatives
- Don't rely on icons alone for critical functions
- Ensure sufficient size for touch targets

---

### Hover & Focus States

**Hover States** (Desktop Only)

- Subtle change (color shift, elevation)
- Immediate feedback
- Don't rely on hover for critical information
- Consider cursor changes (pointer for clickable)

**Focus States** (Keyboard Navigation)

- Highly visible outline or ring
- High contrast (3:1 minimum)
- Never remove without replacement
- Consistent across all interactive elements

Tailwind: `focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:ring-offset-2`

---

### Loading States

**Progress Indicators**

- Spinner for indefinite waits
- Progress bar for known duration
- Skeleton screens for content loading
- Preserve layout (prevent content shift)

**Optimistic UI**

- Show success state immediately
- Revert if action fails
- Reduces perceived wait time
- Use for non-critical actions

---

### Tooltips & Popovers

**Tooltips**

- Short, helpful text
- Appear on hover and focus
- Don't hide critical information
- Positioned to not obscure content
- Escape key to dismiss

**Popovers**

- More detailed information
- Triggered by click or tap
- Clear close button
- Not modal (can interact with page)

---

## Form Design

### Form Layout

**Vertical Forms** (Recommended)

- Labels above inputs
- Faster completion
- Works better on mobile
- Better for long labels

**Horizontal Forms** (Use Sparingly)

- Labels beside inputs
- Saves vertical space
- Harder on mobile
- Good for short forms

---

### Field Organization

**Logical Grouping**

- Group related fields together
- Use fieldsets with legends
- Clear section headings
- Progressive disclosure for optional fields

**Field Order**

- Most important fields first
- Follow natural conversation flow
- Match user expectations
- Consider auto-fill order

---

### Labels & Placeholders

**Labels** (Required)

- Always provide visible labels
- Position above or beside field
- Associate with input programmatically
- Clear, concise text
- Mark required fields

Tailwind: `block text-sm font-medium mb-1`

**Placeholders** (Supplementary)

- Example format, not instructions
- Don't use as labels
- Disappear on focus (bad for memory)
- Lower contrast than input text

---

### Validation & Errors

**Inline Validation**

- Validate as user types (where appropriate)
- Show success checkmarks
- Clear error messages
- Position errors near relevant field

**Error Messages**

- Specific, not generic ("Email must include @" not "Invalid input")
- Helpful, not blaming ("Please enter your email" not "You forgot email")
- Position near field
- High contrast, clear icons
- Persist until corrected

Tailwind: `text-red-600 text-sm mt-1`

**Success Feedback**

- Confirm successful submission
- Clear next steps
- Don't just hide the form

---

### Required Fields

**Marking Required Fields**

- Asterisk (\*) is standard
- Include legend explaining asterisk
- Consider marking optional fields instead if most are required
- Provide accessible indication

**Reducing Fields**

- Only ask for essential information
- Can you get it another way?
- Research shows 20-60% of fields can be eliminated
- More fields = more abandonment

---

### Input Types

**Use Appropriate Input Types**

- Email: Brings up email keyboard on mobile
- Tel: Shows number pad
- Date: Shows date picker
- Number: Shows number controls
- URL: Shows URL keyboard

**Auto-Complete**

- Enable auto-complete for common fields
- Helps password managers

## Final Principles to Remember

1. **Users Don't Read, They Scan** - Make content scannable with headings, short paragraphs, and clear hierarchy

2. **Mobile-First Is Not Optional** - 60%+ of traffic is mobile. Design for small screens first.

3. **Accessibility Benefits Everyone** - Accessible design is better design. It's not just compliance.

4. **Consistency Builds Trust** - Users should never wonder if different elements do the same thing.

5. **Test With Real Users** - Your assumptions about usability are often wrong. Test early and often.

6. **Performance Is UX** - A slow site is a bad experience, no matter how pretty.

7. **Less Is More** - Remove elements until it breaks, then add one back. Simplicity wins.

8. **Design for Thumbs, Not Mouse** - Touch targets must be large and well-spaced.

9. **Provide Immediate Feedback** - Every action needs visual confirmation.

10. **Iterate Continuously** - Good design is never finished. Keep improving based on data and feedback.
