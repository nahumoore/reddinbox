## Workflow

1. **Keyword Input**: The user provides a keyword.

2. **SERP Research & Database Update**:

   - Search: `[keyword]`, `[keyword] guide 2025`, `[keyword] statistics`, `[keyword] tools`, `[keyword] case study`, `[keyword] site:youtube.com`
   - Analyze the **top 10 SERPs** for the main keyword
   - **Collect links from positions 1-5 only** (automatically trustworthy)
   - Identify each article's content outline, structure, style, use of external links, and unique angles
   - **Update `\.claude\link-database.json`** with new findings (url, domain, title, description)
   - Find **2-3 relevant YouTube videos** from search results
   - Aim to use links from blog posts - Only add homepage links if mentioning a product/service.

3. **Research Presentation**: Show updated database and link mapping plan:

   ```
   üîç RESEARCH COMPLETE - DATABASE UPDATED

   NEW LINKS ADDED:
   ‚úÖ domain.com - Page Title - Brief description
   ‚úÖ domain.com - Page Title - Brief description

   YOUTUBE VIDEOS FOUND:
   üé• Channel Name: Video Title - YouTube URL

   LINK MAPPING FOR OUTLINE:
   ‚Ä¢ Section 2: Will use [domain] link about [topic]
   ‚Ä¢ Section 4: Will use [domain] link for [data/stats]

   Ready to create outline?
   ```

4. **Content Outline Creation**:

   - Build an outline by mixing the best sections of the SERPs
   - Improve and reorganize them for readability and authority
   - Re-check `link-database.json` to see all available links for the article
   - Present outline + external and internal link plan to user for approval

5. **Content Generation (Section by Section)**:
   - After the outline is approved, generate the article **section by section**
   - Use **real links from database** integrated naturally, don't duplicate links in the article!

- **Paragraph Length**: Max 2 sentences per paragraph, then line break.
- **Scannability**: Add subheadings every 150‚Äì200 words.
- **Visual Breaks**: Use bullet points, numbered lists, tables, blockquotes every 3‚Äì4 paragraphs.

  Example:  
  `![alt explanation](/blog/{keyword}/{image-name}.jpg)`
- **External Links**: 2‚Äì3 high-authority sources per 500 words from your database. Anchor text must fit naturally into the sentence. Avoid "check this article" phrasing. Don't use the same link twice!
- **Internal Links**: Check the provided folder of existing blog files and insert links in the format:  
  `/blog/{file-name}`
