- **Lead Discovery & CRM** - Identify, track, and nurture potential customers from Reddit interactions
- **Multi-Account Management** - Safely manage multiple Reddit accounts with different personalities/brands
- **Advanced Analytics** - Comprehensive insights on authority building, engagement metrics, and lead conversion

### üé™ **Phase 3: Full Ecosystem**

- **Automated Outreach** - Smart DM sequences for warm leads identified through community engagement
- **Team Collaboration** - Multi-user access for agencies and larger teams
- **Integration Hub** - Connect with existing CRM, email marketing, and social media tools

**Core Philosophy**: Build genuine authority and relationships first, then leverage that trust for sustainable lead generation - the anti-spam approach to Reddit marketing.

## üß± TECH STACK & ARCHITECTURE

### Core Technologies

- **Next.js 14+** with App Router (file-based routing, server components)
- **TypeScript** - Strict type safety throughout the application
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling with custom design system
- **ShadCN UI** - Accessible, composable component library
- **Tabler Icons** - Consistent iconography system
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations and micro-interactions

### Development Standards

- **Component Architecture** - Atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- **State Management** - React Server Components + Client state where needed
- **Data Fetching** - Server actions, streaming, and optimistic updates
- **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, semantic HTML
- **Performance** - Core Web Vitals optimization, code splitting

## üé® DESIGN SYSTEM GUIDELINES

### Styling Priorities

1. **CSS Variables** - Always use custom properties defined in `globals.css`
2. **Tailwind Utilities** - Leverage utility classes for consistent spacing/sizing
3. **ShadCN Components** - Extend base components rather than building from scratch
4. **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach with breakpoint consistency
5. **Two Fonts** - You must handle two fonts: `font-body` which is the main font, and `font-heading` for headers

### UI/UX Principles

- **Clean & Minimal** - Reduce cognitive load, focus on core actions
- **Reddit-Native Feel** - Familiar patterns for Reddit power users
- **Progressive Disclosure** - Show relevant information at the right time
- **Feedback & States** - Clear loading, success, and error states

## üîß DEVELOPMENT CONSTRAINTS

### Code Quality

- **Type Safety** - No `any` types, comprehensive interface definitions
- **Error Handling** - Graceful degradation and user-friendly error messages
- **Testing** - Write testable components with clear separation of concerns
- **Documentation** - Self-documenting code with meaningful variable names

### Database Integration

- **Read-Only Reference** - Use attached DB files for context only
- **No Direct Updates** - Never modify database schemas or SQL when requested
- **Data Modeling** - Understand relationships for optimal UI data flow

### Performance Requirements

- **Bundle Size** - Optimize imports, use dynamic loading for heavy components
- **Rendering** - Prefer server components, minimize client-side JavaScript
- **Caching** - Leverage Next.js caching strategies appropriately

## üìù COMMUNICATION STYLE

- **Technical Precision** - Explain architectural decisions and trade-offs
- **User-Focused** - Consider end-user impact in all recommendations
- **Best Practices** - Reference industry standards and modern patterns
- **Iterative Approach** - Build incrementally with room for future enhancements

## Notes

- Use &apos; and &quot; when designing or creating the html of `.tsx` components.
- You just need to make code updates, NEVER run servers or execute commands apart of coding updates.
- When applying programmatic classes, use `cn` not `class1 ${class2}`
