Most founders approach Reddit with the same broken playbook: post your product link, hope someone clicks, get downvoted into oblivion.

**Reddit doesn't reward self-promotion. It rewards value.**

When you genuinely help people, they don't just upvote, they reach out. They ask questions. They want to know more about you and what you're building.

This is the story of how one value-packed reply turned into a DM conversation and a qualified lead, without a single sales pitch.

## The Setup: Someone Asks the Exact Question You Can Answer

User **Broad-Performance917** posted in r/indiehackers asking about acquiring their first batch of seed users:

<RedditPostCard
  subreddit="indiehackers"
  username="Broad-Performance917"
  title="Regarding how to acquire the first batch of seed users"
>
Hello everyone! Yesterday, I posted my first article about how to acquire the first batch of seed users. Thank you all for your attention and comments. Your comments are very important to me!

Here are the methods I have summarized: joining the free developer community and circles to offer value, listing products on some platforms, etc. My question is: What specific free developer communities are there on Reddit and Discord? What are the ways for me to join genuine and effective free developer communities? And which platforms allow me to release products?

We are eager to secure the first batch of seed users to update and verify our product. We look forward to your response. You can also directly DM me.
</RedditPostCard>

**Why this post mattered:** This wasn't vague. They already understood the value-first approach (joining communities, offering value), but they needed specifics: which communities, which platforms, how to actually execute.

This is a founder who's past theory and ready to act. They're literally asking for the kind of tactical guidance that demonstrates expertise. Perfect opportunity to help genuinely.

## The First Reply: Give Them Exactly What They Asked For

Instead of saying "check out my tool," we gave them the complete tactical breakdown they requested:

In my experience the fastest way is joining niche Reddit subs and active Discord servers, helping first and asking for feedback

Places: Reddit , r/IndieDev, r/SideProject, r/webdev, r/Entrepreneur, r/startups. Discord , Reactiflux, The Programmer's Hangout, Python Discord, Indie Devs. Launch spots: Product Hunt, BetaList, Show HN, Indie Hackers, GitHub Releases, Gumroad

How to join: read rules, lurk, add value, share tiny betas, reward testers

I built something to discover conversations and qualify leads while launching, Reddinbox if you wanna see that approach :)
</RedditReplyCard>

**Why this worked:**

- **Complete Answer**: We listed specific subreddits, Discord servers, and launch platforms, exactly what they asked for. No fluff, just actionable names.
- **Tactical Steps**: "Read rules, lurk, add value" gives them the how, not just the where. This shows we've actually done this before.
- **Soft Plant**: The Reddinbox mention came after value, framed as "if you wanna see that approach," not "buy my tool." It's a breadcrumb, not a billboard.
- **Demonstrates Expertise**: "In my experience" signals this is tested advice, not Google results. We built credibility before mentioning our product.

## The Hook Takes: They Want to Know More

Within minutes, Broad-Performance917 replied:

That sounds great! So the method is to post in these sections and gradually accumulate, right? and can I know how the Reddinbox working?
</RedditReplyCard>

Notice what happened: *they asked about Reddinbox*. We didn't pitch it. We didn't DM them. We simply planted the seed by providing massive value first, and they watered it themselves by asking for more.

This is the moment most founders mess up. They either over-explain and sound salesy, or they drop a link and disappear. Neither builds trust.

## The Value Continues: Explain the Strategy, Not Just the Tool

We replied again, still focused on helping them understand the approach:

Yep , posting + helping is the baseline, but the shortcut is listening for intent, replying fast with value, and offering tiny test invites to people already asking for solutions, not broadcasting to everyone :)

I built Reddinbox to speed that process: it finds relevant Reddit/Discord conversations, surfaces posts with testing or buying intent, suggests authentic and helpful replies, and tracks who engages so you can qualify seed users without chasing noise :)
</RedditReplyCard>

**The key here:** Even when explaining [Reddinbox](/), we framed it around the *strategy* (listen for intent, reply fast, offer tiny invites), then positioned the tool as the way to scale that strategy. We're still teaching, just using our product as the example.

This does two things: it educates them on best practices they can use manually, and it shows how [Reddinbox](/) makes that process faster. No pressure, just context.

## The DM Shift: From Public to Private Conversation

After this exchange, Broad-Performance917 sent a DM:

<RedditChatPreview
  messages={[
    {
      username: "Broad-Performance917",
      message: "Hey bro. Thanks for your comment！ You seem to have a lot of experience in project initiation. Can I learn from you?",
    },
    {
      username: "Nicolas",
      message: "heyy! sure, I initiated like 5 project in the past, have been working on the indie hacking landscape for about 2 years now",
    },
    {
      username: "Nicolas",
      message: "you're u doing?",
    },
       {
      username: "Broad-Performance917",
      message: "cool bro. Our team are doing an AI coding agent for freelance developer... However, we are facing some problems and haven't found an effective way to obtain our initial users",
    },
  ]}
/>

**This is the payoff.** They didn't DM us to buy something. They DM'd to learn from someone they now see as credible. The public thread built enough trust that they wanted a private conversation.

Notice we still didn't pitch. We asked about what they're building, showed genuine interest, and let them share their pain point: struggling to get initial users for their AI coding agent.

## The Natural Close: Only Promote When It's Actually Relevant

Now they've told us their exact problem, the one [Reddinbox](/) is literally built to solve. This is when, and only when, we mention the tool directly:

<RedditChatPreview
  messages={[
    {
      username: "Nicolas",
      message: "nice, in my experience the best way to get your first customers/users is using Reddit, building authority here by helping people while promoting your tool if relevant",
    },
    {
      username: "Nicolas",
      message: "for instance in this case you're looking in ways to find users, here's where I'd promote what I'm building haha",
    },
    {
      username: "Nicolas",
      message: "which here's the link if you wanna take a look at it btw https://reddinbox.com",
    }
  ]}
/>

Even here, we framed it conversationally: "this is where I'd promote what I'm building haha." Self-aware, not pushy. The link comes last, as an "if you wanna check it out" afterthought.

**Result:** Broad-Performance917 visited Reddinbox, explored the platform, and became a qualified lead. All because we helped first, answered questions second, and only shared the link when it made perfect sense.

## Why This Actually Works

**1. Value Before Product**: The first reply gave them exactly what they needed: specific communities, tactical steps. No agenda, just help. This builds instant credibility.

**2. Seed Planting, Not Billboard**: Mentioning [Reddinbox](/) once, casually, in the context of "I built something using this approach" is curiosity-inducing, not sales-y. It's a hint, not a pitch.

**3. They Lead the Conversation**: At every stage, Broad-Performance917 drove the next step. They asked about Reddinbox. They DM'd first. They shared their problem. We responded, we didn't chase.

**4. Educate, Don't Sell**: Even when explaining the tool, we focused on the strategy and principles anyone could use. This positions us as a teacher, not a vendor.

**5. Proof Through Action**: We literally demonstrated the tactic (be helpful on Reddit to build trust) while explaining it. The meta-strategy worked because we were doing it in real-time.

## How You Can Do This Without Reddinbox

**Monitor Niche Subreddits**: Find 3 to 5 communities where your target customers hang out and ask questions you can answer. Set up keyword alerts or check them daily.

**Answer With Zero Agenda**: When you find a relevant post, pretend your product doesn't exist. What would you tell a friend who asked this? Give that answer with specifics, not generic advice.

**Plant One Subtle Seed**: After providing value, you can mention your product once, briefly, in context. "I built X to solve this" or "This is the approach I used for Y." Then move on.

**Let Them Ask**: If your answer was genuinely helpful, curious people will click your profile, ask follow-ups, or DM you. If they don't, your comment still helped someone and others reading the thread.

**Only Pitch When Relevant**: If someone DMs you or asks about your tool, share it, but still lead with education. Explain the why before the what.

## The Reality of Scaling This Manually

Here's the truth: doing this across multiple subreddits, every day, is exhausting. Reddit's search is terrible. You'll miss conversations. You'll reply too late. You'll burn out.

That's exactly why we built [Reddinbox](/) in the first place. It monitors communities for you, surfaces high-intent posts when they're fresh, suggests authentic replies, and tracks who engages so you can follow up with warm leads.

Imagine this same outcome, 10 conversations happening simultaneously, across r/SideProject, r/Entrepreneur, r/startups, and your niche subreddits. That's what Reddinbox does: it scales the value-first approach without making you spend 4 hours a day on Reddit.

But even if you do this manually, the principles work. Help first. Plant seeds. Let them lead. That alone will generate leads you can't get from ads or cold outreach.
