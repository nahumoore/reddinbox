**Experience & Discussion Posts:**
- "How I did X" success/failure stories
- Personal journey shares and case studies
- Open discussion starters seeking community input
- "Anyone else struggling with..." validation posts
- Lessons learned and retrospective posts

**Authority Building Opportunities:**
- Posts with incomplete or incorrect advice (you can add value)
- Detailed questions showing genuine effort/thought
- Community discussions where expertise is valued
- Posts from established accounts (not obvious throwaways)

## FILTER OUT (approved: false) - Low Value/High Risk:

- Generic copy-paste or AI-generated looking content
- Suspicious or shortened links

**Off-Topic/Irrelevant:**
